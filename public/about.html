<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi there! I’m Hubert, and I’m just starting my journey as a web developer. My main focus right now is learning and mastering HTML, the building block of all websites.
  I love how HTML allows me to create the structure of a webpage, making it easy to organize content and ensure everything is in the right place. I’ve been working on small projects to practice my skills, like creating simple web pages and experimenting with different HTML elements.</p>

<p>I’m dedicated to learning more every day and improving my coding abilities. I enjoy participating in online coding challenges and reading up on the latest HTML techniques to stay current.
  When I’m not coding, I like to work out, cook and try out new recipes, and play video games.
  </p>
<p>These hobbies help me stay creative and bring fresh ideas to my web development projects.
  I’m excited to continue growing as a web developer and work on new projects. Let’s create something awesome together!
